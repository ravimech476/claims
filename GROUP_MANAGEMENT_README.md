# Group Management Feature

## Overview
The Group Management feature allows users to create, manage, and execute actions on groups of claims for batch processing.

## Features

### 1. Group Page (`/groups`)
- **Location**: `src/components/GroupPage.js`
- **Route**: `/groups`
- **Description**: Main page for managing claim groups

### 2. Group Table Columns
The group table displays the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Group Name | Name and description of the group |
| Claims | Number of claims in the group |
| Priority | Priority level (High, Medium, Low) |
| Status | Current status (Active, Processing, Inactive) |
| Created | Group creation date |
| Action | Execute button and more options |

### 3. Group Actions

#### Create Group
- Click the "Create Group" button in the header
- Fill in group details:
  - Group Name (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Priority Level (High/Medium/Low)

### 4. Data Storage
Groups are stored in browser localStorage with the key `claimGroups`. The JSON structure includes:

```json
{
  "id": 1234567890,
  "name": "Group Name",
  "description": "Group Description",
  "priority": "High|Medium|Low",
  "status": "Active|Processing|Inactive",
  "claimIds": [],
  "memberCount": 0,
  "processedCount": 0,
  "createdAt": "2025-08-11T12:00:00.000Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-08-11T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```
